This folder contains the Group X1's Lift Group Project.

### Project Description
The aim of this project is to develop a model of a lift system. The project is open-ended, allowing you to explore and learn techniques that interest you or you believe will be useful in the future. The final model is executable in Stateflow/Simlink, enabling you to demonstrate the behavior of the lift system in various scenarios.

### Learning Objectives
- Apply systems tools/processes to a project.
- Collaborate as a team to develop a model.
- Create a simulation of a real-world system.

### Folder Contents
1. PowerPoint Presentation
2. Matlab App
3. Stateflow Model
4. 3D Model
5. Lift Music
6. Floor Names MP3s
7. Warning MP3

### App Instructions
To use the app, follow these steps:
1. Change the directory of the music in the Matlab App.
2. Open the Matlab App and press Ctrl + F to search and replace the current directory with the new one.
3. Ensure that both the Stateflow model and the app are located in the same folder for Matlab to find and open the Stateflow model.

### 3D Model Requirements
The 3D model requires the installation of 3D Matlab extensions to run successfully.
